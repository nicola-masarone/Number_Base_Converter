# Number_Base_Converter
From JetBrains Academy
## About
We’re all quite used to our good old decimal system of numerals. But let’s not forget that there are other ways to count! Whether we need to convert numbers from one system to another just for fun or to store large data more efficiently, a converter proves helpful. In this project, you will create your own tool that will help you convert numbers from one system to another.
## Learning outcomes
You will master loops and functions, learn about numeric data types, and explore different numeral systems including binary — one of the basic concepts in programming.
